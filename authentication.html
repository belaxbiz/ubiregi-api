      <h1>Authentication</h1>
      <p>
        Currently we provide very simple token based authentication mechanism.
        Every installations of client have their own secret tokens which can be used for API access.
      </p>
      <h2>Installation</h2>
      <p>
        A user will <it>install</it> apps to ubiregi.com.
        Installations generate new secret tokens.
        The user have to notify an app its secret token, and the app will be authenticated with the token.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>User need to <it>install</it> an app to use it</li>
        <li>Each installation have their own secret token</li>
        <li>
          There are no automated way to notify app its secret token
          <br />
          (We are planning to provide standardized mechanisms such as OAuth.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        User may <it>uninstall</it> an app.
        Un-installation of an app will invalidate the secret token.
        After your app got uninstalled by the user, your app can not access the user's data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The secret token is installation specific.
        If your user uninstall your application, the token will be invalidated.
        After your user re-install your application, new token will be generated.
      </p>
      <p>
        To install your app, visit your app's install URL.
      </p>
      <img src="images/app_installation.png" width="100%">
      <p>
        You can install/uninstall the app to your account.
        Visit <a href='https://ubiregi.com/installs'>https://ubiregi.com/installs</a> to list all applications you have installed.
      </p>
      <h2>Authorization</h2>
      <p>
        There is only one authorizatioin levels, <strong>everything</strong>.
        If a user allows an app to access its data (installs the app), the app can access everything.
      </p>
      <h1>The protocol</h1>
      <p>
        Give HTTP the following two request headers on all requests.
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th width='190'><code>X-Ubiregi-Auth-Token</code></th>
          <td>
            Users secret token to identify user and installation.
            This is used for authentication.
            Both of you and users are responsible to keep it secret.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th><code>X-Ubiregi-App-Secret</code></th>
          <td>
            To identify your app.
            This can be used to block the app.
            You are responsible to keep it secret.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        If <code>X-Ubiregi-Auth-Token</code> is invalid, your request will result in <code>401</code> (Unauthorized) status.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that there are another possibility to make your request failed.
        <code>402</code> (Payment required) may be returned in the case the user's subscription got expired.
        After the user renew the subscription, the status will be recovered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Check the <a href='ubiregi-api-client-example.rb'>example app</a> to see how the authentication is exactly.
