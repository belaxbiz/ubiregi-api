%h3 Updating CustomerField

:markdown
  Updating value of a `CustomerField` object is not recommended.
  Just create new field, and delte it (set `deleted`).
  
  This is to avoid conflicting changes in two places, for example in your app and in the Ubiregi iPad app.
  If you do not update an existing `CustomerField`, the conflict will result in duplicated fields, and
  user can choose one, and then delete the other. This is safe.
