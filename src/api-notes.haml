%h1#api-notes API Notes

%h2 IDs are Universal

:markdown
  There are only one scope of ID, *Universal*.
  
  If this doc says *ID*, it is an one origin integer value which uniquely determins an object on ubiregi server.

%h2 Special Fields

:markdown
  Most objects have special fields, `created_at` and `updated_at`.

%dl
  %dt= field "created_at", :readonly
  %dd
    Server time at which the object is created.
  %dt= field "updated_at", :readonly
  %dd
    Server time at which the object is updated.

%h2 Permissions on Objects of Other Accounts

:markdown
  Ubiregi API permission model is very simple.
  The permission to a object is decided by its owner account's *role*.
  
  There are three permissions, *nothing*, *readonly* and *writable*.

%dl
  %dt nothing
  %dd Any access will be rejected.
  %dt readonly
  %dd Reading is allowed, but can not update.
  %dt writable
  %dd Full access allowed.
  
:markdown
  There are five roles, *current*, *children*, *parents*, *siblings*, and *others*.

%dl
  %dt current
  %dd The account which is authenticated.
  %dt children
  %dd Children of current account.
  %dt parents
  %dd The accounts of which the current account is a child.
  %dt siblings
  %dd The accounts which shares parents with current account.
  %dt others
  %dd Accounts which is not current, children, parents, and siblings.
  
:markdown
  The permission is defined as following:

%dl
  %dt readonly
  %dd Parents' and siblings' information, menus, checkouts, and stock events.
  %dt writable
  %dd Current's and childrens' information, menus, checkouts, and stock events.
  %dt nothing
  %dd Anything else.

:markdown
  and it is figured out as following.

= image_tag "object-permissions.png"

:markdown
  Each circle represents an `Account`.
  Gray arrows represent parent-child links between accounts.
  Red, green, blue, purple, and gray circles represent *current*, *children*, *parents*, *siblings*, and *others* accounts respectively.
  Green background is for the object which owns objects with *writable* permission, and light-pink background is for *readonly* permission.

  Note that `Customer`s have their own permission model.

%h2 Stock Calculation Model

:markdown
  Each `MenuItem` has its own stock count.
  `stock`, `last_inventory_at`, and `incoming_stock` are updated when new `StockEvent` is created.
  
%dl
  %dt last_inventory_at
  %dd
    Find the latest <code>inventory</code> event, and set its <code>inventory_at</code>.
  %dt stock
  %dd
    Find the <em>latest_inventory_event</em> and its <em>following_events</em>, and calculate the following:
    <blockquote>
    <em>last_inventory_amount</em> - <em>shipped_amount</em> + <em>arrived_amount</em><br>
    where:
    <blockquote>
    <em>last_inventory_amount</em> = <em>latest_inventory_event</em>.<code>amount</code><br>
    <em>shipped_amount</em> = Σ <em>following_shipping_events</em>.<code>amount</code><br>
    <em>arrived_amount</em> = Σ <em>arrival_events</em>.<code>amount</code><br>
    </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  %dt incoming_stock
  %dd
    Calculate all <em>order_events</em> and <em>arrival_events</em>, and calculate the following:
    <blockquote>
    Σ <em>order_events</em>.<code>amount</code> - Σ <em>arrival_events</em>.<code>amount</code>
    </blockquote>
 
%h2 app_created_at Usage

:markdown
  `app_created_at` field is to remember when the object is created in the iPad app.
  It generally meaningless; iPad clock may be inacculate, the clock can easily changed.
  
  It is recommended to record some time, or just use the time of post.

%h2 Private Fields

:markdown
  There may be private fields, not defined in this document but you find in the response from server.
  It is okay if you use these fields, but keep in your mind *they are private* so that it may be removed without any anouncement.
