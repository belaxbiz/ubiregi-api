%h3 Amount of an Event

:markdown
  The interpretation of `amount` depends on the event's `event_type`.

  Assume there is a `StockEvent` object with `amount = 55`.
  It says the following facts depending on `event_type`:

%dl
  %dt "inventory"
  %dd The current stock of the menu is 55.
  %dt "arrival"
  %dd The number of the items arrived is 55.
  %dt "shipping"
  %dd The number of the item shipped is 55.
  %dt "order"
  %dd The number of the item someone ordered is 55.
