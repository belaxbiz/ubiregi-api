<h2 id='ubiregi_web_app_is_build_with_rails'>Ubiregi web app is build with Rails</h2>

<p>We use Ruby on Rails 3 to develop ubiregi.com web app. We carefully described things non-rails-developer should mention about, but may be insufficient.</p>

<p>If you have some problem, you may need to check Rails related documents.</p>

<h2 id='the_api_is_entirely_httpbased_and_restful'>The API is entirely HTTP-based, and RESTful</h2>

<p>Methods to retrieve data from the Ubiregi API requires a GET request. Methods to create new things requires a POST request. And to update things requires a PUT request. Most methods requires a particular HTTP method and will return an error if you do not make your request with the correct one.</p>

<h2 id='json_is_used'>JSON is used</h2>

<p>We use JSON for every structured data. It implies that binary data are encoded with base64 and non-ascii characters are UTF8 encoded.</p>

<h2 id='use_https'>Use HTTPS</h2>

<p>All requests to Ubiregi API must be HTTPS requests.</p>
