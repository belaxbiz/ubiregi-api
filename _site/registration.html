<p>Developers who want to develop an application should register their applications. The registration form will open soon.</p>

<h2 id='developer_account'>Developer Account</h2>

<p>Developer account can be used for testing developer&#8217;s applications.</p>

<p>Accounts marked as developers&#8217; do not expire. However, the Ubiregi application can not be used to register checkouts on the account. This limitation is to prevent someone to use developer account for their daily usage.</p>

<p>We provide a sample application which retrieves the account information and create random checkouts. The application can be used to make sample data.</p>

<p>We are checking all developer accounts if they are used for daily usage. If we found a suspicious account, we will send an email and ask to explain how the account is used. And, if there are no enough explaination, we will stop the account.</p>
