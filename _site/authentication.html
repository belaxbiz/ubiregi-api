<p>Currently we give very simple token based authentication mechanism. Each account has a secret token which can be used for API access.</p>

<p>We are working to provide standardized mechanisms such as OAuth to simplify authentication for users.</p>

<h1 id='authentication'>Authentication</h1>

<p>Just give HTTP request header on all requests named <code>X-Ubiregi-API-Token</code> which contains users API token.</p>

<p>There are no standard mechanisms to give your application account&#8217;s API token. Your application would ask your users to copy-and-paste API token from ubiregi.com web site.</p>
