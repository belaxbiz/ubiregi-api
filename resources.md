# General Notes

## Standard Set of APIs on Collection

Most resource collections provides the following set of APIs.

* Retrieving the collection (Index)
* Creating or updating items (POST)
* **Optional**: Retrieving one item (GET)

## Standard Index Parameters

Indexing actions take a set of parameters; `since`, `until`, and `glb`.
They are used to limit the size of the result sets.

<table>
<tr>
<th>since</th>
<td>Limits the result set to contain only updated items since the parameter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>until</th>
<td>Limits the result set to reject items updated since the parameter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>glb</th>
<td>Greatest lower bound of id of the result set. This is used to retrieve next batch of the collection.</td>
</tr>
</table>

The result set can be described as follows:

> { item | since ≤ item.updated_at ⋀ item.updated_at < until ⋀ glb < item.id }

The items are sorted by their `id`s.

The result will be on following pattern.

<pre>
{
    "timestamp": $Timestamp,
    "next-url": $URL,
    "last-updated-at": $Timestamp,
    $rows: [ $objects ],
}
</pre>

timestamp
: The server time. This is sent for the case client local clock is incorrect. If `until` parameter is specified, `timestamp` will be the requested `until`.

next-url (optional)
: The URL to retrieve next result set. This will be unspecified in the case there are no more results.

last-updated-at
: The timestamp on the time, there were last update of an object which belongs to the resource you requested.

$rows
: Array of objects. The name will be different, `items` for MenuItems, `categories` for Categories, and `checkouts` for Checkouts.

### Fetching Whole Collection

There are limitation on the number of objects contained in one request; this is the reason we accept `glb` parameter.
You might have a question that how to get the whole collection?
A set of requests to fetch collections can be interleaved by requests which updates objects which is contained in the collection.
In that case, the `updated_at` field will be updated and because of the `until` parameter included in the fetch request, the updated objects can not be fetched.

`last-updated-at` field is to handle such case.
If there are no `next-url` field sent, which means there are no more object for the parameters you specified, check if the `timestamp` field is newer than `last-updated-at`.

1. Send a request without `until` and `glb` parameters.
2. Check if the response contains `next-url` field.
3. If contains, fetch the `next-url` and go step 2 again.
4. If not caintains, send a request again but with `since` = `timestamp`, and got step 2 again.

## POST Convention

POST actions to collection create or update more than one items.
This helps to make updating many items faster.

The request will be like the following:

<pre>
[
    { "name": "new object", ... },
    { "name": "another new object", ...},
    { "id": 123, "name": "object to be updated" },
]
</pre>

* If there are no `id` field in an object, it will create new item.
* If there are `id` field in an object, it will update an existing item.

The post action is transactional.
If there are an error processing an item, all creation or update of items will be canceled.
There will be one of *everything ok* or *nothing changed*.

There is no limitation on number of objects in one request, but you should take care of it.
100 items in a request will be ok. 10,000 items in a request should cause a problem.
We will ask you to stop posting too big request, if there are some problem.

# Objects

Every object has `created_at` and `updated_at` fields.

## Notations

$*type*
: Object of the *type*.

$*type*s
: Sequence of objects of the *type*. Usually contents of an array.

base64Encoded
: Base64 encoded string of a binary data.
