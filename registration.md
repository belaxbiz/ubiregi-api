# Registration

Developers who want to develop an application should register their applications.
The registration form will open soon.

## Account

Developer account can be used for testing developer's applications.

Accounts marked as developers' do not expire.
However, the Ubiregi application can not be used to register checkouts on the account.
This limitation is to prevent someone to use developer account for their daily usage.

We provide a sample application which retrieves the account information and create random checkouts.
The application can be used to make sample data.

We are checking all developer accounts if they are used for daily usage.
If we found a suspicious account, we will send an email and ask to explain how the account is used.
And, if there are no enough explaination, we may stop the account.

## Application
