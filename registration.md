# Registration

Developers who want to develop an application should register their applications.
The registration form will open soon.

## Account

> There are no developer registration yet (It is Beta!)

Developer account can be used for testing developer's applications.

Accounts marked as developers' do not expire.
However, the Ubiregi application can not be used to register checkouts on the account.
This limitation is to prevent someone to use developer account for their daily usage.

We provide a sample application which retrieves the account information and create random checkouts.
The application can be used to make sample data.

We are checking all developer accounts if they are used for daily usage.
If we found a suspicious account, we will send an email and ask to explain how the account is used.
And, if there are no enough explaination, we may stop the account.

## Application

To access Ubiregi API using your application, you should register your application.
Visit [Ubiregi developer dashboard](https://ubiregi.com/developer) and register your apps.
(You need an Ubiregi account. It is ok to use a free trial account.)

The left half of the page is registration form, and the right half is your apps.
There are no way to edit your existing apps yet.

Name
: Unique identifier for your application.
  We recommend to give name by inverting your full qualified domain name, like `com.ubiregi.sampleapp`.
  Name prefixed with `com.ubiregi` will be rejected.

Display Name
: The name of your application to be displayed for your user.

Description
: Short description of your application. Make sure this is required.

URL (Optional)
: The URL of your application. 

Once you finished app registration, the app will have the following two properties.

Install URL
: `https://ubiregi.com/apps/aaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd`

Secret
: Random and unique 40 chars sequence

The last part of the install URL is random string, so that the URL can not be infereed. 
Unless you tell your users the URL, the URL can not visit the URL.

Secret is to identify which app the API call is generated by.
This can be used to block malicious API accesses from a client.
You are responsible to keep it secret, or your app may be rejected even if you do not do anything bad.
